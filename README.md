# Plugin issues

Please make an issue here if you have a confirmed bug with one of my plugins. This is **not somewhere to request features**.

---

My plugins are not "dead"; I am struggling with depression, and the goat place Discord is not a good environment for that. I apologise if your issues are being ignored, but please rest assured that I do read them all and will eventually get to most of them.
